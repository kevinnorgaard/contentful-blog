  Hi, I'm &Aacute;ine [Aun-yuh]. &Aacute;ine Carina. I'm an artist, traveler, girly-girl, a bit of a control freak, and creator of Carina Collective. I created this lifestyle blog as a platform to share my favorite approaches to style, beauty, art, and wellness. As a female in her 20s, I have been able to navigate many ways for humans of all ages to experience a well-balanced and well-lived lifestyle at a wallet-friendly price.
  <br>
  <br>
  This collective is designed to share my tactics on shopping methods, life hacks, approaches to alternative health and wellness protocols, and other plentiful ways to live a fulfilling (and often pampered) lifestyle. I believe that everybody has the ability to receive more out of their life with a little sprinkle of help and research that isn't always so easy to find.
